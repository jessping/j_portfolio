    "The purpose of the project is to develop a movie recommendation system for Netflix based on the given dataset. The project aims to provide users with personalized recommendations for movies in the Comedy genre that have a high rating and a significant number of votes. By analyzing the dataset and applying filters based on genre and votes, the project identifies the top-rated comedy movies that meet the specified criteria. The purpose is to help users discover and explore popular comedy movies on Netflix, enhancing their viewing experience and assisting them in finding movies that align with their preferences."

    "The project utilizes various techniques and libraries to implement the movie recommendation system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Cleaning: The script performs data cleaning operations to preprocess the dataset and ensure its quality for analysis. Techniques such as dropping unnecessary columns, removing duplicates, and converting data types are employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Filtering: The script filters the dataset based on the specified genre (\"Comedy\") to focus on movies within that category. It uses the str.contains() method to identify rows that contain the desired genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Manipulation: The script calculates a weighted average score for each movie, considering the number of votes and the overall mean rating. This manipulation allows for a more personalized ranking of movies. Additionally, the script uses numpy (np) library to calculate the quantile for setting the votes threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Sorting and Display: The script sorts the movies based on their weighted average scores in descending order and displays the top recommendations. The pandas library is used for sorting the DataFrame and the IPython.display library is used to present the recommendations in a visually appealing manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project relies on the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pandas (pd): Used for data manipulation and analysis, including reading the dataset from a CSV file, dropping columns, handling missing values, and performing sorting operations.\n",
    "- numpy (np): Utilized for numerical computations, specifically calculating the quantile for determining the votes threshold.\n",
    "- IPython.display: Employed for displaying the top recommendations in a tabular format.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques and libraries enable the project to process and analyze the movie dataset, filter movies based on genre and votes, calculate a weighted average score, and present the top recommendations to the users."

    "The Python script implements a Netflix movie recommender system for the Comedy genre. By analyzing the dataset, filtering by genre, applying a votes threshold, and calculating a weighted average score, the script provides insights into the top-rated comedy movies on Netflix. These recommendations can assist users in discovering highly-rated movies in the Comedy genre that have received a significant number of votes. The script demonstrates the application of data cleaning, filtering, and ranking techniques to derive meaningful insights from a given dataset."

    "- Dataset Source: The script utilizes a dataset sourced from a CSV file containing information about movies on Netflix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Cleaning: The script performs data cleaning operations to prepare the dataset for analysis. It drops unnecessary columns such as year, certificate, duration, description, and stars. Duplicate movie titles are removed to ensure uniqueness in the dataset. The 'votes' column is cleaned by removing commas and converting the values to float data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filtering by Genre: The script filters the dataset based on a specified genre. In this case, the genre chosen is \"Comedy\". Only movies that have the genre \"Comedy\" (case-insensitive) in their genre column are retained for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Votes Threshold: A votes threshold is applied to filter out movies with a lower number of votes. The threshold is set at 0.8, which means that movies with votes below the 80th percentile will be excluded from the recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weighted Average Score: The script calculates a weighted average score for each movie in the dataset. The weighted average takes into account the number of votes and the overall mean rating of the movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top Recommendations: The script sorts the movies based on their weighted average scores in descending order and displays the top recommendations. The number of top recommendations shown is set to 20."
